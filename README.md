# Genetic Algorithm for Solving TSP

This project contains a Python-based implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The entire implementation, including various methods (selection, crossover, and replacement), is in a single file: `GA_TSV_With_All_Methods_Types.py`.

## Features
- Different selection techniques (e.g., tournament, roulette wheel).
- Multiple crossover options (e.g., ordered, partially matched).
- Replacement mechanisms for evolution control.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FaresAlhomazah/Genetic-Algorithm-TSV-.git
    cd Genetic-Algorithm-TSV-
    ```
2. **Run the algorithm**:
    ```bash
    python GA_TSV_With_All_Methods_Types.py
    ```

## Usage
Provide details here about any specific input parameters or configurations the script requires.
